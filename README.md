# Henry Rollins KCRW download

Don't know what you think about, but I'm a big fan of Henry Rollins' KCRW show...  

Tired about silly web players and the annoying kcrw app, I deceided to write down a little script to download all the episodes.

I tried with Python, an (almost) unknown language to me.

In the realization I had to fight with dead links, missing media tag infos and so on. I think it's impossibile to find all the episodes (the show started in 2009), but I think we're near the 90%.  

The script will take a lot of time to do all the stuff, but you can stop and resume when you want.

## Usage

Simply  
```python3 download.py 1 459```  
will (try to) download all the episodes between 1 and 459 (exclusive), and save them in the same folder.
